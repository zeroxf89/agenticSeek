## Setup for running LLM locally on your machine

**We recommend using at the very least Deepseek 14B, smaller models will struggle with tasks especially for web browsing.**


**Setup your local provider**  

Start your local provider, for example with ollama:

```sh
ollama serve
```

See below for a list of local supported provider.

**Update the config.ini**

Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to a supported provider and provider_model to `deepseek-r1:14b`

NOTE: `deepseek-r1:14b`is an example, use a bigger model if your hardware allow it.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama # or lm-studio, openai, etc..
provider_model = deepseek-r1:14b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
```

**List of local providers**

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (set `provider_name` to `lm-studio`)|
| openai    | Yes     |  Use openai compatible API  |


Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Run with an API** section if your hardware can't run deepseek locally*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Setup to run with an API

Set the desired provider in the `config.ini`. See below for a list of API providers.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = google
provider_model = gemini-2.0-flash
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000 # doesn't matter
```
Warning: Make sure there is not trailing space in the config.

Export your API key: `export <<PROVIDER>>_API_KEY="xxx"`

Example: export `TOGETHER_API_KEY="xxxxx"`

**List of API providers**
  
| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API  |
| deepseek-api  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

*We advice against using gpt-4o or other closedAI models*, performance are poor for web browsing and task planning.

Please also note that coding/bash might fail with gemini, it seem to ignore our prompt for format to respect, which are optimized for deepseek r1.

Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)

*See the **Known issues** section if you are having issues*

*See the **Config** section for detailled config file explanation.*

---

## Start services and Run

Activate your python env if needed.
```sh
source agentic_seek_env/bin/activate
```

Start required services. This will start all services from the docker-compose.yml, including:
    - searxng
    - redis (required by searxng)
    - frontend

```sh
sudo ./start_services.sh # MacOS
start ./start_services.cmd # Window
```

**Options 1:** Run with the CLI interface.

```sh
python3 cli.py
```

**Options 2:** Run with the Web interface.

Start the backend.

```sh
python3 api.py
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see the web interface.

---

## Usage

Make sure the services are up and running with `./start_services.sh` and run the AgenticSeek with `python3 cli.py` for CLI mode or `python3 api.py` then go to `localhost:3000` for web interface.

You can also use speech to text by setting `listen = True` in the config. Only for CLI mode.

To exit, simply say/type `goodbye`.

Here are some example usage:

### Coding/Bash

> *Make a snake game in python*

> *Show me how to multiply matrice in C*

> *Make a blackjack in golang*

### Web search

> *Do a web search to find cool tech startup in Japan working on cutting edge AI research*

> *Can you find on the internet who created AgenticSeek?*

> *Can you use a fuel calculator online to estimate the cost of a Nice - Milan trip*

### File system

> *Hey can you find where is contract.pdf i lost it*

> *Show me how much space I have left on my disk*

> *Can you follow the readme and install project at /home/path/project*

### Casual

> *Tell me about Rennes, France*

> *Should I pursue a phd ?*

> *What's the best workout routine ?*


After you type your query, AgenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task.

Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query.

Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say:

`Do you know some good countries for solo-travel?`

Instead, ask:

`Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel`

---

## **Setup to run the LLM on your own server**  

If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server using our custom llm server. 

On your "server" that will run the AI model, get the ip address

```sh
ip a | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 # local ip
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # public ip
```

Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address.

Clone the repository and enter the `server/`folder.


```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/server/
```

Install server specific requirements:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server script.

```sh
python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333
```

You have the choice between using `ollama` and `llamacpp` as a LLM service.


Now on your personal computer:

Change the `config.ini` file to set the `provider_name` to `server` and `provider_model` to `deepseek-r1:xxb`.
Set the `provider_server_address` to the ip address of the machine that will run the model.

```sh
[MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:70b
provider_server_address = x.x.x.x:3333
```


Next step: [Start services and run AgenticSeek](#Start-services-and-Run)  

---

## Speech to Text

Please note that currently speech to text only work in english.

The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file:

```
listen = True
```

When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent's name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent's name by updating the `agent_name` value in the *config.ini* file:

```
agent_name = Friday
```

For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like "John" or "Emma" as the agent name

Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent's name aloud to wake it up (e.g., "Friday").

Speak your query clearly.

End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include:
```
"do it", "go ahead", "execute", "run", "start", "thanks", "would ya", "please", "okay?", "proceed", "continue", "go on", "do that", "go it", "do you understand?"
```

## Config

Example config:
```
[MAIN]
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:11434
agent_name = Friday
recover_last_session = False
save_session = False
speak = False
listen = False
work_dir =  /Users/mlg/Documents/ai_folder
jarvis_personality = False
languages = en zh
[BROWSER]
headless_browser = False
stealth_mode = False
```

**Explanation**:

- is_local -> Runs the agent locally (True) or on a remote server (False).

- provider_name -> The provider to use (one of: `ollama`, `server`, `lm-studio`, `deepseek-api`)

- provider_model -> The model used, e.g., deepseek-r1:32b.

- provider_server_address -> Server address, e.g., 127.0.0.1:11434 for local. Set to anything for non-local API.

- agent_name -> Name of the agent, e.g., Friday. Used as a trigger word for TTS.

- recover_last_session -> Restarts from last session (True) or not (False).

- save_session -> Saves session data (True) or not (False).

- speak -> Enables voice output (True) or not (False).

- listen -> listen to voice input (True) or not (False).

- work_dir -> Folder the AI will have access to. eg: /Users/user/Documents/.

- jarvis_personality -> Uses a JARVIS-like personality (True) or not (False). This simply change the prompt file.

- languages -> The list of supported language, needed for the llm router to work properly, avoid putting too many or too similar languages.

- headless_browser -> Runs browser without a visible window (True) or not (False).

- stealth_mode -> Make bot detector time harder. Only downside is you have to manually install the anticaptcha extension.

- languages -> List of supported languages. Required for agent routing system. The longer the languages list the more model will be downloaded.

## Providers

The table below show the available providers:

| Provider  | Local? | Description                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ollama    | Yes    | Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider |
| server    | Yes    | Host the model on another machine, run your local machine |
| lm-studio  | Yes    | Run LLM locally with LM studio (`lm-studio`)             |
| openai    | Depends  | Use ChatGPT API (non-private) or openai compatible API  |
| deepseek-api  | No     | Deepseek API (non-private)                            |
| huggingface| No    | Hugging-Face API (non-private)                            |
| togetherAI | No    | Use together AI API (non-private)                         |
| google | No    | Use google gemini API (non-private)                         |

To select a provider change the config.ini:

```
is_local = True
provider_name = ollama
provider_model = deepseek-r1:32b
provider_server_address = 127.0.0.1:5000
```
`is_local`: should be True for any locally running LLM, otherwise False.

`provider_name`: Select the provider to use by it's name, see the provider list above.

`provider_model`: Set the model to use by the agent.

`provider_server_address`: can be set to anything if you are not using the server provider.

## FAQ

**Q: What hardware do I need?**  

| Model Size  | GPU  | Comment                                               |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 7B        | 8GB Vram | ⚠️ Not recommended. Performance is poor, frequent hallucinations, and planner agents will likely fail. |
| 14B        | 12 GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 3060) | ✅ Usable for simple tasks. May struggle with web browsing and planning tasks. |
| 32B        | 24+ GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4090) | 🚀 Success with most tasks, might still struggle with task planning |
| 70B+        | 48+ GB Vram (eg. mac studio) | 💪 Excellent. Recommended for advanced use cases. |

**Q: Why Deepseek R1 over other models?**  

Deepseek R1 excels at reasoning and tool use for its size. We think it’s a solid fit for our needs other models work fine, but Deepseek is our primary pick.

**Q: I get an error running `cli.py`. What do I do?**  

Ensure local is running (`ollama serve`), your `config.ini` matches your provider, and dependencies are installed. If none work feel free to raise an issue.

**Q: Can it really run 100% locally?**  

Yes with Ollama, lm-studio or server providers, all speech to text, LLM and text to speech model run locally. Non-local options (OpenAI or others API) are optional.

**Q: Why should I use AgenticSeek when I have Manus?**

This started as Side-Project we did out of interest about AI agents. What’s special about it is that we want to use local model and avoid APIs.
We draw inspiration from Jarvis and Friday (Iron man movies) to make it "cool" but for functionnality we take more inspiration from Manus, because that's what people want in the first place: a local manus alternative.
Unlike Manus, AgenticSeek prioritizes independence from external systems, giving you more control, privacy and avoid api cost.
